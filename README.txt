Colourz is now an open source program. Anyone can see the code. Its main purpose is to generate colours and translate them between RGB and HEX. To generate the colours I am using 3 trackers with the max value of 255 for each, every tracker represents a primary colour (red, green, blue). Or you can use a custom input in text boxes located right next to the trackers. This program automatically translates your RGB code and puts it in Hexadecimal code. Another feature you can save colours. Randomly generate colours at a set speed. There are a few customisable options for this program but in the future I aim to add a lot more, so please, give me feedback on what I can improve. Follow us :)
